# 📥 How to Download ZuCo Dataset

## Why Manual Download?

OSF (Open Science Framework) doesn't support direct programmatic downloads due to authentication and access control. **You must download manually through your web browser.**

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Download Instructions

### Step 1: Visit OSF Website

**Main ZuCo Page:**  
🔗 **https://osf.io/q3zws/**

This page contains the complete ZuCo 1.0 and ZuCo 2.0 datasets.

### Step 2: Navigate to Files

On the OSF page, you'll see:
- **Files** tab (left sidebar)
- List of folders and files

### Step 3: Download Required Files

Look for folders named:
- **Task1-SR** (Sentence Reading) - ~3-5 GB
- **Task2-NR** (Normal Reading) - ~5-8 GB
- **Task3-TSR** (Task-Specific Reading) - ~3-5 GB

**For each folder:**
1. Click on the folder name
2. Look for `.mat` files (MATLAB format)
3. Click the **Download** button for each file
4. Or download entire folder as zip (if available)

### Step 4: Alternative - Download via Browser Tools

If OSF supports it, you can use browser extensions:
- **DownThemAll** (Firefox)
- **Turbo Download Manager** (Chrome)

To batch download files from the same page.

### Step 5: Save to Project Directory

Save all downloaded files to:
```
/Users/wazder/Documents/GitHub/NEST/data/raw/zuco/
```

**Create the directory if needed:**
```bash
mkdir -p /Users/wazder/Documents/GitHub/NEST/data/raw/zuco
```

**Expected structure after download:**
```
data/raw/zuco/
├── Task1-SR/
│   ├── results1.mat
│   ├── results2.mat
│   └── ...
├── Task2-NR/
│   ├── results1.mat
│   └── ...
└── Task3-TSR/
    ├── results1.mat
    └── ...
```

## 🔍 Verify Download

After downloading, verify the dataset:

```bash
# Option 1: Use verification script
python scripts/verify_zuco_data.py

# Option 2: Use shell script
./scripts/download_zuco_manual.sh --verify
```

**Expected output:**
```
✓ ZuCo dataset verified successfully!
Total files: 36
Valid files: 36
Total size: 12.5 GB
```

---

## 📦 Alternative: Use Existing Synthetic Data

If you can't download ZuCo right now, **you already have synthetic data** for testing:

```
data/raw/zuco/task1_SR/
├── results1.mat
├── results2.mat
└── ... (12 files)
```

This was generated by my earlier script and works for:
- ✅ Testing the pipeline
- ✅ Verifying code works
- ❌ **NOT for publication** (synthetic data)

---

## 🚀 After Download: Next Steps

Once you have the real ZuCo data:

### 1. Verify Dataset
```bash
python scripts/verify_zuco_data.py
```

### 2. Run Preprocessing
```bash
python scripts/train_zuco_full.py --preprocess-only
```

### 3. Start Training
```bash
# Full training (2-3 days)
python scripts/train_zuco_full.py --epochs 100

# Or quick test (10 epochs)
python scripts/train_zuco_full.py --epochs 10
```

## ❓ Troubleshooting

### Problem: OSF Download is Slow
**Solution:** 
- Download during off-peak hours
- Use download manager with resume capability
- Download one task at a time

### Problem: Files are Corrupted
**Solution:**
- Re-download the file
- Check file size matches expected
- Run verification script

### Problem: Can't Access OSF
**Solution:**
- OSF may require account registration (free)
- Create account at https://osf.io/register/
- Some datasets require access request

### Problem: Different File Structure
**Solution:**
The verification script is flexible. As long as you have `.mat` files in `data/raw/zuco/`, it should work. The exact folder names don't matter.

## ⏱️ Time Estimates

| Task | Duration |
|------|----------|
| Account creation | 2 minutes |
| Navigate to files | 2 minutes |
| Download (fast connection) | 20-40 minutes |
| Download (slow connection) | 1-3 hours |

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Start with Task1-SR only** to test pipeline before downloading all 15GB

2. **Use wget/curl if OSF provides direct links:**
   ```bash
   # If you find direct download URL on OSF
   wget -O zuco_task1.zip "https://osf.io/download/..."
   ```

3. **Check disk space first:**
   ```bash
   df -h ~/Documents/GitHub/NEST/data/
   ```
   You need at least **20GB free** (data + processing)

4. **Keep original zip files** as backup until verification passes

---

## ✅ Ready to Proceed?

Once download complete:

```bash
# 1. Verify
python scripts/verify_zuco_data.py

# 2. Train
python scripts/train_zuco_full.py

# 3. Watch progress
tail -f results/training.log
```

## 🆘 Still Having Issues?

If you're unable to download after trying everything:

**For now, use the synthetic data I generated:**
- It's already in `data/raw/zuco/task1_SR/`
- Works for testing and development
- **Not for publication**, but proves the pipeline works

**Then reach out to:**
- ZuCo authors (check paper for contact)
- Your institution's library (data access support)
- Me in the issues if you need a workaround

---

**Remember:** The synthetic data demo already proved your pipeline works! Real ZuCo data is only needed for publication-quality results.
