## Conclusion

NEST is a **high-quality, well-documented, and production-ready framework** for EEG-to-text decoding. With the recent additions of comprehensive testing, CI/CD, and development tools, the project has reached a strong foundation for v1.0.0 release.

**Key Remaining Work**:
- Real-world validation with complete ZuCo training
- Pre-trained model release
- Academic paper submission

**Recommendation**: Project is ready for **beta release (v1.0.0-beta)** with the caveat that experimental results are pending. A full v1.0.0 release should include at least one complete training run with reported metrics.
