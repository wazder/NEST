## 🔄 From Demo to Real Research

To get publication-ready results, replace synthetic data with real ZuCo:

```bash
# 1. Download real ZuCo dataset
python scripts/download_zuco.py --tasks all
# Manual download from: https://osf.io/q3zws/

# 2. Run full training (2-3 days)
python scripts/train_zuco_full.py \
    --config configs/model.yaml \
    --output results/final/ \
    --epochs 100

# 3. Verify real results
python scripts/verify_results.py \
    --results results/final/results.json

# 4. Regenerate figures with real data
python scripts/generate_figures.py \
    --results results/final/ \
    --output papers/figures/
```
